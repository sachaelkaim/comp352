# comp352
data structure project
This is the final project for data structure and algorithm class. Made a system that stored licence plate keys and car values
using a LinkedHashmap and an arraylist structure. Threshold can be set to pick between these two ADT'S dynamically while adding, removing,
uploading file...  A built in menu is created where you can lookup keys and values, nextkey,prevkey  and more.
